At Tiny Hands/Love Justice, we have dedicated our lives to serving, protecting, and helping local men, women and children. For that reason,
we are committed to preventing human trafficking and the enslavement of males and females by deception. Having heard the
testimonies of hundreds of men and women who have been deceived and enslaved, we believe human trafficking is one of the worst
injustices in the world, and we are tirelessly dedicated to preventing it. At the same time, we fully recognize the right of girls, boys,
women and men to migrate for work or other legitimate reasons. Our goal is to allow all safe and legitimate migration, while
preventing unsafe migration and migration by deception--which almost always leads to enslavement and exploitation. We care about
you, and that is why you are here. We only want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you. We care about your story and what
happened to you. Your story can help us to better understand human trafficking and migration and learn to better serve and help
protect precious individuals around the world. It can also help us to identify traffickers and save other individuals from being enslaved.
With your cooperation, your story can help save other people from exploitation! By signing this consent, you are giving Tiny Hands
Nepal permission to use any information provided throughout the duration of your time with the staff for operational and awareness
purposes. If you choose to NOT have your story shared or information used for awareness, please check the box below:
